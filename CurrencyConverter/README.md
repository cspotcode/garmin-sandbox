Bare-bones currency converter for travel.

Goals:

- native numeric inputs for ease of use, no tiny keypads on touchscreens
- quick access when in shops: as a widget
- manual conversation rate input, no magic sync which might break or require internet, and you can also factor in exchange fees if you want
